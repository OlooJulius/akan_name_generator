                    The Akan is a unique group of people found in Ghana and Ivory Coast. Historically, the Ghanaian population migrated to the Ivory Coast and became the most populous group of people in the country. The Akan language is known as Fante
                     or Twi; it is a group of dialects within the Niger-Congo family of languages

                        the Guinea Coast who speak Akan languages
                        of the Kwa branch of the Niger-Congo family).

                        (Ashanti), Attié, Baule, Brong, Chakosi, Fante (Fanti), 
                        and Guang languages; some scholars also consider Twi 
                        a distinct Akan language. Most Akan peoples 
                        live in Ghana, where they settled in successive waves of 
                        migration between the 11th and 18th centuries; others inhabit the eastern part of Côte d’Ivoire and parts of Togo.

                        Akan people are believed to have migrated to their current location
                        from the Sahara desert and Sahel regions of Africa into the forest 
                        region around the 11th century, and many Akans told their history 
                        as it started in the eastern region of Africa as this is 
                        where the ethnogenesis of the Akan as we know them today happened
